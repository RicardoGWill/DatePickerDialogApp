# DatePickerDialogApp
This app allows you to pick a date (including year, month, and day). When you pick a date, a Toast pops up showing the date that you picked. Another method (currentDateDefault()) makes it so that the first date shown in the dialog is the current date. Also, note that the month displayed for the Toast would be one month behind if we did not add "+1" to the month.
